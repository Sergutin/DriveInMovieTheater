<h1>First Drive-In Movie Theater in Cork</h1>

<p>This project introduces a website of the first drive-in movie theatre in Cork. It doesn’t exist in real life, there is no car cinema in Cork for now, but this website might be the very first step towards its implementation.</p>
<p>Target audience: all age groups, families with children, young adults.</p>
<p>The main goal of the project is to provide all information about Cork Drive-In Movie Theatre, its location, general overview, movies broadcasted etc. Through this website people can get interested in the service we offer and visit our movie theater.</p>
